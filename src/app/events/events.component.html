                        we believe networking and getting together is essential to develop and improve
your skills and keeps you on top of the latest trends and updates. Getting
together is an avenue to exchange ideas and to support each other. The
Collaborative Auckland understands how moving to a new country can be hard
on students and teachers. Many may feel confused or homesick, therefore we
are dedicating our resources to provide events and functions for all our clients
and get you to meet others and make you feel home. This page is going to list all
activities and functions we are hosting or whatâ€™s happening around you.<br><br>Please stay tuned.
